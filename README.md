# Big Money App Idea

## Table of Contents

### Introduction

This application was developed as way to help educate people and to understand their budgeting habbits providing a way for them to be able to set goals based on their income, current needs and the things that they want. This app was developed after I put our a request on LinkedIn to see if there was some cool idea's out their for an application and this was one which I was keen to explore a bit more to get to an MVP level. 

My client: Andrew Taylor

The idea: to try and develop an app similar to the pocketbook app but using a rewards based system where they could set different things want either wanted to or needed to purchase. This would sit over their bank app giving them a easy to use  GUI to help test and manage their budgets and understand different elements about their spending. 

The goal: To deliver a level of functionality consistent with an MVP level concept which we could then explore further after testing and reviewing.

### Development stages:

#### First communication - LinkedIn Post :

As I wanted to see whether I could take on a project with a real life client so I put a request on my LinkedIn to see if there were any cool ideas which would suit the project brief. I got a lot of traction online and two ideas stuck with me:

1. MRI scanning tests for training Doctors and identifying and understanding different types of scans.
2. Budgeting app aimed at helping young people understand all elements of their business.

As I had limited time I tried to organise meetings as quickly as I could and unfortunately it was a lot harder to be able to get the potential clients to sit down so we could discuss the project. The person doing the MRI scanning was in the end unavailable to participate in the project as he was looking at developing the application through an agency which left the budgeting app to develop.
