# Big Money App Idea

## Table of Contents

### Introduction

This application was developed as way to help educate people and to understand their budgeting habbits providing a way for them to be able to set goals based on their income, current needs and the things that they want. This app was developed after I put our a request on LinkedIn to see if there was some cool idea's out their for an application and this was one which I was keen to explore a bit more to get to an MVP level. 

My client: Andrew Taylor

The idea: to try and develop an app similar to the pocketbook app but using a rewards based system where they could set different things want either wanted to or needed to purchase. This would sit over their bank app giving them a easy to use  GUI to help test and manage their budgets and understand different elements about their spending. 

The goal: To deliver a level of functionality consistent with an MVP level concept which we could then explore further after testing and reviewing.

### Development stages:

#### First communication - LinkedIn Post :

As I wanted to see whether I could take on a project with a real life client so I put a request on my LinkedIn to see if there were any cool ideas which would suit the project brief. I got a lot of traction online and two ideas stuck with me:

1. MRI scanning tests for training Doctors and identifying and understanding different types of scans.
2. Budgeting app aimed at helping young people understand all elements of their business.

As I had limited time I tried to organise meetings as quickly as I could and unfortunately it was a lot harder to be able to get the potential clients to sit down so we could discuss the project. The person doing the MRI scanning was in the end unavailable to participate in the project as he was looking at developing the application through an agency which left the budgeting app to develop.


#### First Meeting 1:

For the first meeting I sat down with the client and went through the structure of his idea and how it would work. The first part of what we discussed was a) what did the app need to solve and b) what was his vision for an MVP version of that app. We ran through the user cases and how this application would be used in the future. 

The key outcomes of this meeting were to:

- Set the expectations on both of our ends especially around the input from both parties and what the hopeful expected outcome would be for the project.
- The best form of communication and a plan to meet up and discuss the project as certain elements were defined and achieved. We agreed that Trello would be the best way to define the user cases and follow our development plan as it progressed. 
- Expectations around client and developer including the expectations for the code and who owns it.

#### Meeting 2:

The second meeting was organised just over a week later due to unforeseen circumstances which didn't provide us a lot of time to be able to fianlise the design and how the processes.

In this meeting we discussiong the:

- First Initial [Insert designs here] app design including the layout and how each different element process would work. 
- The budgeting formula and process: This was an element this still had not been finalised and played a large role in how the application would get designed and developed. The key outcome for this was that there were two initial ways we could go about designing the budgeting process:

1. A priority based system. This would use the persons income, them assigning certain transactions from their bank account as bills and assigning a weekly amount to spend on food, groceries etc. Then a certain amount would be set aside where they could put money aside a portion of their money depending on the level of priority and total cost of that item. This was a concept which I put forward but on feedback from the client this was not the initial system he was looking for and he asked for the weekend to better understand how he wanted the process to work.

2. An item based system. This would be based on capping the total amount of items that they could put in their budgeting and designate a different portion of their disposable income based on the total amount of items available. The issue was this was that it would take a lot of different functionality and provide issues when trying to display the data based on the state that I had setup for the assigment. In the end, we agreed to leave it for now and try to see how far we could get with the structure he wanted and if we needed we could adjust the rules around the application after reviewing it further.

#### Meeting 3 - Final Meeting:

The final meeting was aimed at discussing where we were currently at with the MVP product and what would be next in the development stages. As far as the assignment process and development there are still quite a few issues around how the process will work and the rules which would need to be built into the actual application to ensure that the application achieves it's core goals and also is functional to a certain extent. The atual concept will continue to be developed but I believe that the actual budgeting process needs to be more formalised before proceeding to the final stage of development.
